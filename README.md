# discuss
Nodejs discussion forum project.

## Getting started.
To start, download the latest files and extract them. Go to the directory and edit the config files. Then, open up your console and cd to the directory, then run `node install/init.js`. If any errors pop up, just do what the error says, they are pretty self explanitory. You should then be able to run the main app.js file, and tada, your forum is online!
